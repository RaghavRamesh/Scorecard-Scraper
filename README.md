# Scorecard-Scraper

### What it is?
A script that scrapes partnership data from a cricket scorecard, given the scorecard URL. (Should be of this format - [url](http://seasonedprosg.com/Scorecard2015?Live=0&id=1200))

### How to run?
Download or clone the repository. Then run:

```node scraper.js```

### TODO
* Compute partnership from fall of wickets and batsmen list
* Accept scorecard URL as a parameter instead of hardcoding
